Here you can find the code and hardware designs for the sensor motes used by the [Data Sensing Lab](http://datasensinglab.com) at Google I/O in 2013. Details of the previous generation of motes, used at the O'Reilly Strata conferences have their [own repository](https://github.com/aallan/SensorMote).
